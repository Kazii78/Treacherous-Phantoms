# Treacherous-Phantoms
A datapack that turns phantoms into more annoying rebels by picking you up and dropping you from the sky to your doom down below.

To remove the datapack completely, run:
```
/function tchp:config/remove
```
either in the chat or the console.
Afterwards you may remove it from the files if `/reload` wasn't ran.
